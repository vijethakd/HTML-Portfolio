<h2> Hey There, This is Vijetha byndoor</h2>

<p> I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do. —Leonardo da Vinci</p>
<p> I am currently working as a Software Analyst at Capgemini. I have pursued my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Kammavari Sangham Institute of Technology. I believe patience is a means to bettering myself, and it requires managing tough situations in a confident and effective manner. Like the old saying goes, there is no “I” in “TEAM”.</p>
